# get skilled

It's 2021-10-15. Just a few minutes passed midnight and I'm sitting on a dim lit room with a bowl of milk and Koko Krunch chocolate cereals by my macbook. I was about to sleep, watch a TV show or two at netflix before turning off the lampshade and hit the bed. But I remembered that I havent done anything productive yesterday. Didnt spend at least 30 minutes bettering myself, and that's not how you win. It's time to get skilled bros LEZGO
